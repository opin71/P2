<h1>Unit 1, Outcome 1</h1> 
<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
<p>The GDPR legislation executes the law for an organisations&rsquo; compliance with the data protection principles. This includes the organisation&rsquo;s effective data protection policies and procedures and their responsibility in maintaining them and informing an individual or organisation if you have misused or inaccurately shared their personal data.</p>
<p>I have provided a list of 11 obligations to ensure that your website GDPR compliant:</p>
<p><strong>1. Raise awareness across your business about GDPR</strong><br>
Key people and decision-makers need to be aware of the GDPR, so they can understand the potential impact and identify areas that require attention for compliance. Start by registering any risks, if you have one and go to the Information Commissioners Website for information on how to do a Data Privacy Impact Assessment for your business.</p>
<p><strong>2. Audit all personal data</strong><br>
A Data Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) involves documenting the personal data a business holds, where it came from and who they share it with and the compliance, exemption, risk and breach in those three areas.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Put your privacy notice on your website for the public access</strong><br>
  When you collect personal data, you will need to use a privacy notice containing Data Protection Act compliant information such as your identity and how you intend to use their information.<br>
You will need to explain:<br>
your legal basis for processing the data<br>
  your data retention periods<br>
  their right to complain to the ICO if they think there&rsquo;s a problem with how you are handling their data<br>
Privacy Notices on websites are an important compliance measure and need to be publically accessible and noticable on your website.</p>
<p><strong>4. Review your procedures supporting individuals&rsquo; rights</strong><br>
  You need to make sure you have the procedures in place so you can comply with, an individual&rsquo;s request to provide them with the data you have on them electronically and in a commonly used format.<br>
  The main rights for individuals under the GDPR are to:<br>
  allow subject access<br>
  have inaccuracies corrected<br>
  have information erased<br>
  prevent direct marketing<br>
  prevent automated decision-making and profiling<br>
allow data portability</p>
<p><strong>5. Put in place procedures supporting subject access requests</strong><br>
Under GDPR, you are unlikely to be able to charge for complying with requests. There are also different grounds for refusing to comply with a subject access request, and if you refuse a request you need to have policies and procedures in place to demonstrate why the request meets these criteria.</p>
<p><strong>6. Identify and document your legal basis for processing personal data</strong><br>
  Under the GDPR, there is a legal basis for processing personal data. So you need to understand the various types of data processing you carry out, identify your legal basis for carrying it out and document it in the below criteria for legal basis:
  <br>
  Consent<br>
  Contract<br>
  Legal obligation<br>
  Vital interests<br>
  Public task<br>
Legitimate interest</p>
<p><strong>7. Review how you seek, obtain and record consent</strong><br>
If you rely on an individuals&rsquo; consent to process their data, it must meet the standards required by the GDPR. If not, you will need to change your consent mechanisms or find an alternative to consent. The GDPR is clear that data controllers must be able to demonstrate that consent was given. So you may need to review the systems you have for recording consent and ensure you have an effective audit trail.</p>
<p><strong>8. Review the data you hold on children</strong><br>
You need to have safeguarding measures in place for children and adults&rsquo; personal data and if your website collects information about children under the age of 13, you will need parental/guardian consent to process their data lawfully.</p>
<p><strong>9. Establish procedures to detect, report and investigate a personal data breach</strong><br>
  The GDPR requires that all website owners notify the ICO of all data breaches where the individual is likely to suffer some form of damage, such as through identity theft or a confidentiality breach. So you need to set up processes to detect, report and investigate breaches.<br>
Note that failure to report a breach could result in a fine, as well as a fine for the breach itself.</p>
<p ><strong>10. Review your processes around Data Privacy Impact Assessments (DPIAs)</strong><br>
  You may be required to carry out a privacy impact assessment (PIA) in a high-risk situation such as a new technology deployment, or where operations are likely to significantly affect individuals.<br>
To prepare for such an eventuality, the ICO recommends you familiarise yourself with their PIA Code of Practice so you can work out how best to implement DPIAs in your organisation. Think about where it might be necessary to conduct a DPIA in your organisation. Who will do it? Who else needs to be involved? Should the process be run centrally or locally?</p>
<p><strong>11. Appoint a Data Protection Office (DPO)</strong><br>
If your organisation employees 250 or more people, is a public authority or is involved in the regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, you should appoint a data protection officer. The DPO should take proper responsibility for data protection compliance and have the knowledge, support and authority to do so effectively.
