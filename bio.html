      <h1>About Me: Janette Nelson</h1></center>

    <p>My diverse experience of 25 years has led to a multi-career path which comprises of short-term and long-term contract positions in both the private and public sector.</p>
    <p>I have worked in the pioneering stages of global digital entertainment communities and market intelligence subsequently, I have witnessed their evolution e.g. Napster to Spotify (peer to peer vs client server architecture - centralised and decentralised storage), the analogue to the digital revolution, as well as the transference from business intelligence to cultural asset mapping and data centricity</p>
    <p>This could be why digital transformation is a fluid concept for generation X (which includes me) because we are at the relevant axis of practical awareness and experience, which provides us with the ability to translate between analogue and digital fluidly.</p>
    <p>I have worked as a Retail Product Trainer and Tactical Technical Brand Representative for Smart Technologies brands and these are some of the companies I have worked for e.g Sennheiser (Smart Headphones and Speakers),  Bowers and Wilkins (Smart Headphones and Speakers) Hive (Smart Home), in gaming for ACER Predator (PC and Laptop) and in telecommunications for Three Mobile (Go Roam).</p>
